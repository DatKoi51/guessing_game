This project is from the Rust Programming Language tutorial found on the Rust website. I really wanted to learn Rust and get hands on experience.

This project taught me of the Rust concepts such as let, match, .trim() to remove trailing and leading whitespaces, .parse() to convert a string to another type, 
the ability for functions to handle exceptions by return Result with either Ok() or Err(), .except() to print a message when an error occurs.
